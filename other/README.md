# What are these files doing here?

These files are useful configuration or other files I found that don't exactly belong to me or anyone else in particular, and that can be downloaded elsewhere from the Internet.

I bundled them here because they are extremely useful to enhance a fresh installation in my systems, without having to go ahead and redownload them again. They are mostly free VPN config files in case you are in a hostile network and need to "escape" without raising the usual Tor-related suspicion. You can find all of them [here](http://vpngate.net/en/) anyway, but as that site might be blocked or down (happens more often than you'd think!) I provide them already as a means to reduce censorship probability.
